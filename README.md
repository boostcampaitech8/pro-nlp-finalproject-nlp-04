# DIV(Design In Vibe): AI-Powered Agentic Writing Assistant

**DIV(Design In Vibe)** is an advanced AI agent system designed to transform abstract user ideas into concrete, comprehensive project plans and documents. Built with **LangGraph** and **Streamlit**, it orchestrates a team of specialized agents—Idea, Plan, Research, and Visual—under a central Supervisor to collaboratively author high-quality content.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: A Supervisor agent intelligently routes tasks to specialized sub-agents based on user intent.
- **Idea Structuring**: Transforms vague inputs into structured blueprints with clear objectives and scope.
- **Deep Research**: Autonomous research agent performs web searches (Tavily/DuckDuckGo) to gather evidence and validate claims.
- **Visual Generation**: Automatically generates data visualizations (Charts, Mermaid diagrams) to support the content.
- **Incremental Writing**: Generates long-form documents section by section, ensuring coherence and depth.
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly Streamlit interface for real-time interaction and feedback.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 1. Supervisor Graph (Central Control)
The **Supervisor** serves as the central control unit, analyzing user input and routing tasks to the appropriate sub-agents.

```mermaid
graph TD
    start((Start)) --> supervisor
    
    supervisor[Supervisor Node]
    router{Router Logic}
    
    supervisor --> router
    
    router -->|ASK_USER| ask_user[Ask User]
    router -->|RUN_IDEA_STRUCTURING| prepare_idea[Prepare Idea Structuring]
    router -->|RUN_PLANNING| plan_phase[Plan Phase]
    router -->|RUN_RESEARCH| research_phase[Research Phase]
    
    ask_user --> user_input((End/User Input))
    
    prepare_idea --> idea_graph[[Idea Subgraph]]
    idea_graph --> supervisor
    
    plan_phase[[Plan Subgraph]] --> supervisor
    
    research_phase[[Research Subgraph]] --> supervisor

    style router fill:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
```

### 3. Interaction Sequence Diagram
This sequence diagram illustrates the detailed interaction flow between the Supervisor and the Agents.

    Note over Supervisor: Analyze User Input

    end
    
    Idea-->>Supervisor: Return Structured Idea
    
    Supervisor->>Plan: Request Plan Drafting
    
    Note over Plan: Attempt Draft Section
    Note over Plan: Evaluate Research Need

        Note over Research: Query Gen -> Web Search -> Analysis
        loop Deep Search
            Research->>Research: Collect & Verify Info
        end
        
        Research-->>Supervisor: Return Verified Evidence
        Supervisor->>Plan: Rewrite Section (Resume Planning)
    end

## ⚙️ Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys. Refer to `src/config/config.py` for variables.

```ini
# .env
UPSTAGE_API_KEY=your_solar_pro_api_key
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the Streamlit application using `uv`:

```bash
uv run streamlit run src/main.py
```

The application will open in your default browser. You can start by entering a topic or idea in the chat input.
